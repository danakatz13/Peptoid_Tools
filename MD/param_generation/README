# How to parametize non-standard amino acids in AMBER

## Generating non-standard amino acid residue
To start, we need to generate a .pdb/.mol2 file of the capped residue by itself. If you have this available, skip this step.

To generate these consistent structure files, we use their SMILES, written as either a primary amine (peptoid) or a peptide residue (NC(R)C(=O)) for a non-canonical amino acid.

decompse2smiles.py will generate a .pdb of the capped residue.
